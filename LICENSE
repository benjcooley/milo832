ATTRIBUTION NOTICE:

This project is derived from and inspired by the SIMT-GPU-Core project
by Aritra Manna (https://github.com/aritramanna/SIMT-GPU-Core).

The original SystemVerilog implementation has been translated to VHDL
and extended with additional graphics pipeline components including:
- Hardware rasterizer
- Texture sampling unit
- Raster operations pipeline (ROP)
- Command processor for host CPU interface

We gratefully acknowledge the original author's contribution to the
open-source hardware community.
