## 2. Microarchitecture Specification

### 2.1 Pipeline Overview

The core implements an in-order, dual-issue 5-stage pipeline with out-of-order memory completion.

#### Stage 1: IF (Instruction Fetch)

- **Warp Scheduler**: Utilizes a Loose Round-Robin policy to select "Ready" warps.
- **Fetch Unit**: Retrieves a 64-bit instruction bundle (PC and PC+4 (implied)) from I-Cache/Instruction Memory.
- **Throughput**: capable of fetching 2 consecutive instructions for the selected warp.

#### Stage 2: ID (Instruction Decode & Issue)

- **Decoding**: 64-bit Instruction words are decoded into opcode, register indices, and immediate values.
- **Scoreboard**: A bit-vector scoreboard tracks pending register writes to enforce RAW (Read-After-Write) and WAW (Write-After-Write) dependencies.
- **Dual-Issue Logic**: The scheduler attempts to issue two consecutive instructions (A and B) simultaneously. The following table shows valid pairings:

| Instruction A Type                  | Can Pair With | Cannot Pair With | Reason                          |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **ALU** (ADD, SUB, MUL, etc.)       | FPU, LSU, SFU | ALU, CTRL        | Same functional unit conflict   |
| **FPU** (FADD, FMUL, FFMA, etc.)    | ALU, LSU, SFU | FPU              | Same functional unit conflict   |
| **LSU** (LDR, STR, LDS, STS)        | ALU, FPU, SFU | LSU              | Only 1 memory port per warp     |
| **SFU** (SIN, COS, RSQ, etc.)       | ALU, FPU, LSU | SFU              | Same functional unit conflict   |
| **CTRL** (BRA, BEQ, BNE, BAR, etc.) | _None_        | All              | Control flow must execute alone |

**Additional Constraints:**

- **RAW Hazard**: Instruction B cannot read a register that A writes (checked via scoreboard).
- **WAW Hazard**: Both instructions cannot write to the same destination register.
- **Control Flow**: Branches (`BRA`, `BEQ`, `BNE`), barriers (`BAR`), synchronization (`SSY`, `JOIN`), and function calls (`CALL`, `RET`) **always issue alone**.

#### Stage 3: OC (Operand Collector)

- **Function**: Buffers instructions and gathers source operands from the Register File.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Arbitrates access to the banked Register File to handle bank conflicts without stalling the main pipeline.
- **Forwarding**: Implements "Snoop-based Forwarding" to capture data directly from the Writeback bus, bypassing register reads for back-to-back dependent instructions.

#### Stage 4: EX (Execute)

- **ALU**: 32-lane integer arithmetic logic unit (ADD, SUB, BITWISE, SHIFT).
- **FPU**: IEEE-754 Single Precision Floating Point Unit (based on [Hardfloat](https://github.com/ucb-bar/berkeley-hardfloat)).
- **SFU**: Special Function Unit for transcendental functions (SIN, COS, RSQ).
- **Branch Unit**: Evaluates conditions and manages the Divergence Stack.

#### Stage 5: MEM (Memory)

- **LSU**: Handles `LDR`/`STR` (Global) and `LDS`/`STS` (Shared) operations.
- **Address Calculation**: Computes effective addresses and manages coalescing.

#### Stage 6: WB (Writeback)

- **Writeback Arbiter**: Selects results from ALU, FPU, and Memory subsystems.
- **Register File Update**: Writes data back to the register file and clears Scoreboard entries.

### 2.2 Thread Hierarchy & Scheduling

- **Warp Organization**:
  - **32 Threads per Warp**: Executed in lockstep (SIMT).
  - **24 Warps per Core**: Supporting up to 768 concurrent threads resident on the SM.
  - **Warp ID**: 5-bit identifier (0-23).

- **Multithreading Model**:
  - **Fine-Grained Multithreading (FGMT)**: The core can switch between warps on a cycle-by-cycle basis to hide latency.
  - **Latency Hiding**: When a warp stalls (scoreboard dependency, memory wait, barrier), the scheduler immediately switches to another ready warp.

- **Scheduling & Switching Rule**:
  - **Greedy Scheduling**: The scheduler **stays with the same warp** as long as it has eligible instructions (no scoreboard conflicts, no resource stalls).
  - **When do Warps Switch?**: Warps switch when:
    1. The current warp **stalls** (RAW dependency, memory operation pending, barrier wait).
    2. The current warp **completes** (hits `EXIT` or diverges to inactive state).
  - **Two-Loop Search Mechanism**: When a new warp is needed, the scheduler uses a two-loop search:
    - **Outer Loop**: Iterates through all 24 warp slots starting from `rr_ptr` (round-robin pointer).
    - **Inner Check**: For each warp, checks if it's eligible (state = READY, no scoreboard conflicts, operand collector has space).
    - **First-Match**: Selects the **first eligible warp** found and breaks the search.
    - **Pointer Update**: After selection, `rr_ptr` advances to `(selected_warp + 1) % 24`, ensuring fairness and preventing starvation.
  - **Context Switching Overhead**: **Zero Cycles**. All warp architectural state (PC, Registers, Active Mask) is fully resident in hardware, allowing instantaneous switching without saving/restoring context to memory.

## 3. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Reference

### 3.1 Instruction Encoding Format (64-bit)

The ISA uses a fixed 64-bit instruction length to accommodate 3 source registers, a destination, predicates, and immediate values.

## 4. Subsystem Deep Dive

### 4.1 Operand Collector (OC)

The Operand Collector is a critical microarchitectural feature inspired by NVIDIA Fermi/Kepler architectures. It decouples the fetching of instructions from the reading of operands.

- **Motivation**: Register File banks are single-ported. If an instruction needs operands `R0` (Bank 0) and `R4` (Bank 0), it cannot read both in one cycle.
- **Mechanism**:
  1.  Instructions are allocated to a **Collector Unit (CU)**.
  2.  The CU requests operands from the **Bank Arbiter**.
  3.  The Arbiter grants access based on bank availability (Interleaved Layout: `Bank = RegID % 4`).
  4.  Once all operands are collected, the CU becomes **READY** and dispatches to the Execution Units.
     

  <img width="2816" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86b3ae2d-6af3-47ca-badc-dc51a82482b1" />
  

### 4.2 Divergence Stack (SSY/JOIN)

To handle **Single Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT)** divergence on control flow, the core maintains a per-warp **Divergence Stack**.

- **Divergence & Serialization**: When a condition (`if (tid < 16)`) splits the warp, the hardware:
  1.  Pushes the current `Active Mask`, `PC`, and `Token` onto the stack via `SSY`.
  2.  Updates the `Active Mask` to only enable threads taking the branch (e.g., threads 0-15).
  3.  **Serializes execution**: Threads 0-15 execute the "then" path while threads 16-31 are masked off (inactive).
  4.  After the "then" path completes, the hardware flips the mask to execute the "else" path with threads 16-31 active.
- **Re-convergence**: When all divergent paths complete, a `JOIN` instruction:
  1. Pops the stack.
  2. Restores the full `Active Mask`, re-activating all threads.

This hardware mechanism allows for nested branches and loops without software overhead. **Key Point**: Divergent paths are executed **serially** (one after another), not in parallel, which can reduce effective throughput when warps diverge frequently.

<img width="2816" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/672f6bb3-55a1-4032-b976-cc6f48fe1fda" />


### 4.3 Shared Memory System

- **Capacity**: 16KB per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).
- **Layout**: 32 Banks (word-interleaved).
- **Conflict Handling**: The Shared Memory Controller detects if multiple threads address the same bank in the same cycle. Implementation creates a **Replay Trap**, serializing the conflicting requests over multiple cycles to ensure correctness.

### 4.4 Barrier Synchronization (Epoch Consistency)

"Epoch consistency" in the context of the hardware barrier (`BAR`) refers to a protection mechanism against **race conditions** that can occur when warps executing in parallel have different execution speeds (the "fast-warp" problem).

- **The Problem**: Imagine a loop with a `BAR`. If a fast warp reaches the barrier, waits, releases, and rapidly hits the _same_ barrier again in the next iteration before a slow warp has even reached it the _first_ time, the barrier logic could get confused (counting the fast warp's second arrival as the slow warp's first).
- **The Solution**: The core implements a `barrier_epoch` bit that toggles every time the barrier resolves. Warps track their local "Seen Epoch". A warp contributes to the barrier only if its local epoch matches the global barrier epoch, ensuring that all warps must fully exit synchronization phase `N` before any can enter `N+1`.

### 4.5 Predicated Execution

The core supports **per-thread predication** to enable fine-grained conditional execution without branching.

- **Predicate Registers**: Each thread has **7 predicate registers** (P0-P6), plus an implicit **P7** which is always `true`.
- **Setting Predicates**: Comparison instructions (`ISETP`, `FSETP`) evaluate conditions and write boolean results to predicate registers:
  ```assembly
  ISETP.LT P1, R0, R1    ; P1 = (R0 < R1) for each thread
  ```
- **Conditional Execution**: Instructions can be predicated using the `PRED` field in the instruction encoding:
  ```assembly
  @P1 ADD R2, R3, R4     ; Only execute if P1 is true for this thread
  @!P1 SUB R2, R3, R4    ; Only execute if P1 is false (negated)
  ```
- **Execution Mask**: During execution, the final active mask is computed as:
  ```
  exec_mask = warp_active_mask & predicate_mask
  ```
  Threads with `exec_mask[i] = 0` are masked off and do not write results.

**Use Case**: Predicates allow simple conditionals without divergence overhead. For example, `if (x > 0) y = x * 2` can be implemented as:

```assembly
ISETP.GT P1, R_x, 0
@P1 MUL R_y, R_x, 2
```

<img width="2816" height="1536" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_lved18lved18lved" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b16378-6fa1-47d8-9ec4-da306981f358" />


- **LSU Split Handling**: The LSU automatically detects when a warp's memory accesses span multiple 128-byte cache lines. It utilizes a **Replay Queue** to serialize these into multiple sequential requests to the memory system, transparently to the warp scheduler.

- **MSHR (Miss Status Holding Registers)**: Each warp has a **64-entry MSHR table** that tracks pending memory operations, allowing the core to hide massive memory latencies.
  - **Transaction ID**: Each memory request is assigned a unique 16-bit ID composed of:
    - `[5:0]` Slot ID (0-63) within the warp's MSHR
    - `[9:6]` Warp ID (0-23)
    - `[15:10]` SM ID (for multi-SM systems)
  - **FIFO Management**: Free Transaction IDs are managed via a per-warp FIFO. When a load/store issues, it pops an ID; when the response arrives, the ID is reclaimed.

- **Out-of-Order Completion**: Memory responses can arrive in any order. The MSHR table maps each Transaction ID back to:
  - Destination register (`rd`)
  - Active thread mask
  - Original memory addresses (for unpacking responses)

- **Scoreboard Clearing**: When a memory response arrives, the corresponding register's scoreboard bit is cleared, allowing dependent instructions to proceed.

**Example Flow**:

1. Warp 0 issues `LDR R5, [addr]` → Allocates Transaction ID `0x0010` (Slot 16, Warp 0)
2. Request sent to memory with ID `0x0010`
3. Warp 0 continues executing other instructions (R5 is scoreboarded)
4. Memory responds with ID `0x0010` → MSHR lookup → Write data to R5 → Clear scoreboard

**Transaction ID Reclamation**:
To prevent resource exhaustion, Transaction IDs must be recycled after use:

1. **Initialization**: At reset, all 64 Transaction IDs (0x0000-0x003F for Warp 0) are pushed into the warp's FIFO.
2. **Allocation**: When a `LDR`/`STR` issues, the core pops an ID from the FIFO. If the FIFO is empty, the warp stalls until an ID becomes available.
3. **Reclamation**: When a memory response arrives:
   - The MSHR entry is marked invalid (`mshr_valid[warp][slot] = 0`)
   - The Transaction ID is pushed back into the FIFO
   - The MSHR slot becomes available for reuse
4. **Store Completion**: For stores (`STR`), the ID is reclaimed immediately after the write is acknowledged (no data to return).

**Critical Constraint**: A warp can have at most **64 outstanding memory operations**. If all IDs are in use, the warp stalls at the LSU stage until at least one response arrives and reclaims an ID.

**Data Hazard Prevention with Out-of-Order Completion**:
Even though memory responses arrive out-of-order, **RAW (Read-After-Write) hazards are prevented** through the scoreboard:

1. **Scoreboard Set on Issue**: When `LDR R5, [addr]` issues, the scoreboard bit for R5 is **immediately set** (before the memory request is sent).
2. **Dependent Instructions Stall**: Any subsequent instruction that reads R5 (e.g., `ADD R6, R5, R7`) is blocked at the ID stage by the scoreboard check.
3. **Scoreboard Clear on Response**: When the memory response for R5 arrives (possibly out-of-order with other loads), the scoreboard bit is cleared, allowing dependent instructions to proceed.
4. **No WAW Hazard**: Multiple loads to the same register are prevented by the scoreboard (second load cannot issue until first completes).

**Example with Out-of-Order Completion**:

```assembly
LDR R1, [addr1]   ; Issues at cycle 10, scoreboard R1 = 1
LDR R2, [addr2]   ; Issues at cycle 11, scoreboard R2 = 1
ADD R3, R1, R2    ; STALLS at ID stage (R1 and R2 scoreboarded)
```

- Memory response for R2 arrives at cycle 50 → Clear scoreboard R2
- Memory response for R1 arrives at cycle 60 → Clear scoreboard R1
- `ADD` can now proceed (both operands ready)

**Key Insight**: The scoreboard acts as a **reservation system**, ensuring that even if R2's data arrives before R1's, the `ADD` instruction only proceeds when **both** operands are available.

### 4.7 Return Address Stack (CALL/RET)

The core supports **hardware function calls** via a per-warp Return Address Stack.

- **Stack Depth**: 8 levels per warp (supports up to 8 nested function calls)
- **CALL Instruction**: Pushes the return address (`PC + 1`) onto the stack and branches to the target
- **RET Instruction**: Pops the return address from the stack and resumes execution
- **Stack Pointer**: Each warp maintains a 3-bit stack pointer (`warp_ret_ptr`)

**Limitation**: Stack overflow (>8 nested calls) results in undefined behavior. This is sufficient for most GPU kernels, which typically avoid deep recursion.

### 4.8 Pipeline Hazards & Squashing

The core handles **control flow changes** (branches, divergence) by squashing incorrectly fetched instructions.

- **Branch Tag**: Each warp has a 2-bit `branch_tag` that increments on every branch/divergence event
- **Tag Propagation**: Instructions carry the branch tag from the warp at fetch time
- **Squash Detection**: If an instruction's tag doesn't match the current warp tag, it's from a mispredicted path
- **Shadow NOP**: Squashed instructions are converted to "Shadow NOPs":
  - They propagate through the pipeline to clear scoreboard bits
  - They do **not** write to registers or memory
  - This prevents deadlock from scoreboard entries that would never clear

**Example**:

1. Warp 0 fetches instructions at PC=10, PC=11 (tag=0)
2. Branch at PC=10 redirects to PC=50 → `branch_tag` increments to 1
3. Instruction at PC=11 (tag=0) reaches EX stage
4. Tag mismatch detected (0 ≠ 1) → Convert to Shadow NOP
5. Shadow NOP clears scoreboard for any destination register, preventing deadlock

## 5. Verification & Performance

### 5.1 Methodology

The core is verified using a layered SystemVerilog testbench (`TB/`) running actual **CUDA-like** assembly kernels.

## 5.2 Benchmark: 8x8 Tiled Matrix Multiplication Dem

The core includes a robust testbench (`TB/TB_SV/test_app_matmul.sv`) that verifies a **Tiled Matrix Multiplication** algorithm. This test performs `C = A * B` for 8x8 matrices using a CUDA-like assembly kernel.

### Memory Layout

- **Matrix A (8x8)**: Global Address `0` to `255` (Row-major).
- **Matrix B (8x8)**: Global Address `256` to `511` (Row-major).
- **Matrix C (8x8)**: Global Address `1024` to `1279`.
- **Shared Memory**: 16KB available (Base `0` used for Tile A, Base `256` for Tile B).

### Why Tiling & Shared Memory?

**Problem**: Naive matrix multiplication requires each thread to load the same row/column elements from global memory multiple times. For an 8x8 matrix, this results in **64 global memory accesses per thread** (8 loads of A, 8 loads of B, repeated 8 times).

**Solution**: Tiling with shared memory provides:

1. **Data Reuse**: Load each tile into shared memory **once**, then reuse it across all threads in the warp. This reduces global memory traffic by **~8x**.
2. **Low Latency**: Shared memory has **~100x lower latency** than global memory (~1-2 cycles vs ~100-400 cycles).
3. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Coalesced loads from global memory maximize memory bandwidth utilization.

**Result**: The tiled implementation completes in **487 cycles**, whereas a naive implementation would require **~3000+ cycles** due to repeated global memory stalls.

### Kernel Assembly Code

The following is the actual assembly program executed by the cores. It demonstrates **Shared Memory Tiling**, **Barrier Synchronization**, and **Fused Multiply-Add**.

```assembly
// 1. Thread Initialization
MOV R15, 0          ; Constant Zero
TID R0              ; R0 = Lane ID (0-31)
MOV R10, 0          ; R10 = Shared Base A
MOV R11, 256        ; R11 = Shared Base B
MOV R12, 1024       ; R12 = Global Base C

// 2. Load Tile from Global -> Shared
// Calculate Global Address
MOV R6, R0          ; simple 1-1 mapping for 8x8 block
SHL R14, R6, 2      ; R14 = Byte Offset (TID * 4)

// Load A[tid] -> SharedA[tid]
LDR R7, [R14 + 0]   ; Load from Global A
STS [R14 + 0], R7   ; Store to Shared A

// Load B[tid] -> SharedB[tid]
ADD R5, R14, 256    ; Offset for B
LDR R7, [R5 + 0]    ; Load from Global B
STS [R5 + 0], R7    ; Store to Shared B

// 3. Barrier Synchronization
BAR                 ; Wait for all threads to load Shared Memory

// 4. Compute Dot Product (8 iterations)
// Setup coordinates
SHR R1, R6, 3       ; Row = TID / 8
AND R2, R6, 7       ; Col = TID % 8
MOV R3, 0           ; Unroll Loop for k=0..7

// Pointers
SHL R4, R1, 5       ; RowOffset = Row * 32
ADD R7, R10, R4     ; PtrA = SharedBaseA + RowOffset
SHL R4, R2, 2       ; ColOffset = Col * 4
ADD R8, R11, R4     ; PtrB = SharedBaseB + ColOffset

// Inner Loop (x8 unrolled)
LDS R9, [R7]        ; Load A[Row][k]
LDS R4, [R8]        ; Load B[k][Col]
IMAD R3, R9, R4, R3 ; Accumulate: R3 += A * B
ADD R7, R7, 4       ; Increment PtrA
ADD R8, R8, 32      ; Increment PtrB (Stride 8 words)
// ... repeat 7 more times ...

// 5. Store Result
SHL R4, R6, 2       ; Offset = TID * 4
ADD R5, R12, R4     ; Address = BaseC + Offset
STR [R5 + 0], R3    ; Store Result C[tid]
EXIT
```

### Verification Output

The simulation initializes `A` with linear values (1..64) and `B` as an Identity matrix. The expected result `C` is identical to `A`.

### 5.3 Benchmark: 3D Wireframe Cube with Perspective

The core is capable of full 3D graphics orchestration. A dedicated demo (`TB/TB_SV/test_perspective_cube.sv`) implements:

- **Assembly Shader**: A vertex shader executing 3D rotations (Y-dynamic, X-static) and perspective projection.
- **Math Engine**: Utilizes the **SFU** for trigonometric functions and **IDIV** for depth-based coordinate scaling ($x_{proj} = x \cdot f / z$).
- **Rendering**: Directly writes projected vertices into the $64 \times 64$ framebuffer in global memory.

### 5.4 Benchmark: Parallel 3D Cube (SIMT Demo)

This kernel parallelizes the 3D Perspective Cube by assigning one thread to each vertex (8 active threads). It demonstrates a ~3x speedup over the sequential version.

```bash
./verify_specific.sh TB_SV/test_parallel_cube.sv
```

- **Performance**: 34,368 Cycles (vs 99,312 sequential).
- **Techniques**: SIMT Parallelism, Predicated Serialization (Software ROP).
- **Outcome**: Verifies efficient SIMT execution and correct Register File bank conflict handling under heavy load.

### 5.5 Limitations & Future Work

- **Rasterization**: Currently supports point-based vertex rendering; full triangle rasterization is a future milestone.
- **L1 Cache**: While the LSU supports splits, the current model uses a `mock_memory`. Integration with a genuine set-associative L1 cache is planned as a next step.
